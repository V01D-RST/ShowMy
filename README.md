# ShowMy

**ShowMy** is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that lets players view personalized stats and information about themselves using natural, readable commands like:

```
/showmy rank
/showmy balance
/showmy kills
```
It's like saying: ‚ÄúShow my rank‚Äù ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly what the plugin does. It‚Äôs simple, intuitive, and powered by PlaceholderAPI for dynamic, real-time content.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
- **This plugin requires PlaceholderAPI 2.11.6**‚ÄîAll dynamic content is powered by it, and ShowMy will not work without it.
- Java Version: 21 or higher.
## Features
- **Natural command structure** ‚Äî /showmy <something> feels like normal speech
- **Displays personalized info** ‚Äî rank, balance, stats, links, and more
- **Fully configurable modules** in config.yml
- **Permission-based access** to each module
- **In-game reload command** to update the config instantly without restarting the server
- **PlaceholderAPI integration** for real-time dynamic data
- **Optional debug logging** for admin insight
## Example Use Cases
|Command|Reult Shown|
|---|---|
|/showmy rank|Your current rank is: %luckperms_primary_group%|
|/showmy balance|Your balance is: %vault_eco_balance%|
|/showmy kills|You've got %statistic_player_kills% kills!|
|/showmy coords|Your current coords are: %player_x% %player_y% %player_z%|

Note that **these commands don't come in the plugin by default**, you will need to create them manually in the config.
